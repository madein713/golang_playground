# Project 1 EDTECH
## Functional requirements

### Course Catalog Microservice:
This microservice is responsible for managing the course catalog, which includes course details such as title, description, instructor, duration, and prerequisites. The microservice should allow users to search and filter courses based on various criteria, such as course type, level, and subject.

### Enrollment Management Microservice:
This microservice is responsible for managing the enrollment process for courses. It should allow users to enroll in courses and manage their enrollment status. The microservice should also allow instructors to manage their course rosters and track student progress.

### Progress Tracking Microservice:
This microservice is responsible for tracking student progress and generating progress reports. It should track student completion status for each course, track their scores and grades, and generate reports based on this data.

### User Management Microservice:
This microservice is responsible for managing user accounts and authentication. It should allow users to create and manage their accounts, reset their passwords, and manage their preferences.

### Payment Processing Microservice:
This microservice is responsible for processing payments for courses. It should integrate with payment gateways to accept various payment methods and manage payment transactions.

### Content Delivery Microservice:
This microservice is responsible for delivering course content to users. It should provide access to course materials such as videos, slides, and quizzes.

### Analytics Microservice:
This microservice is responsible for collecting and analyzing data on user behavior and course performance. It should provide insights such as course completion rates, student engagement, and course ratings.

### Notification Microservice:
This microservice is responsible for sending notifications to users. It should provide notifications for course updates, upcoming deadlines, and new content releases.

## Description for each
### Course Catalog Microservice:
This microservice will be responsible for managing the course catalog. It should provide functionality to add, update, and delete courses. It should also allow users to search and filter courses based on various criteria.
For writing this microservice, I would suggest using a RESTful API design, which is a widely used standard for building web APIs. You can use the Golang "net/http" package to create a RESTful API that handles HTTP requests and responses. Additionally, you can use the "gorilla/mux" package to help with routing and URL handling.

For the database, you can use a NoSQL database such as MongoDB or a relational database such as MySQL. Both have advantages and disadvantages, so it depends on your specific requirements. For example, if you need to store complex data structures, a NoSQL database may be a better fit.

### Enrollment Management Microservice:
This microservice will be responsible for managing the enrollment process for courses. It should provide functionality to enroll and unenroll users from courses. It should also allow instructors to manage their course rosters and track student progress.
For writing this microservice, I would suggest using a similar RESTful API design as the course catalog microservice. You can use the Golang "net/http" package and "gorilla/mux" package for routing and URL handling.

For the database, you can use the same database as the course catalog microservice. You can also consider using a message broker such as RabbitMQ for handling asynchronous events, such as sending notifications to users when they are enrolled in a course.

### Progress Tracking Microservice:
This microservice will be responsible for tracking student progress and generating progress reports. It should provide functionality to track course completion status, scores, and grades.
For writing this microservice, I would suggest using a similar RESTful API design as the course catalog and enrollment management microservices. You can use the Golang "net/http" package and "gorilla/mux" package for routing and URL handling.

For the database, you can use the same database as the course catalog and enrollment management microservices. You can also consider using a caching layer such as Redis to store frequently accessed data, such as progress data for a course.

### User Management Microservice:
This microservice will be responsible for managing user accounts and authentication. It should provide functionality to create and manage user accounts, reset passwords, and manage user preferences.
For writing this microservice, I would suggest using a similar RESTful API design as the other microservices. You can use the Golang "net/http" package and "gorilla/mux" package for routing and URL handling.

For authentication, you can use a popular authentication and authorization framework such as OAuth2 or JWT. These frameworks provide a standardized way of handling authentication and authorization, which can help simplify your code and improve security.

For the database, you can use a relational database such as MySQL to store user data.

### Payment Processing Microservice:
This microservice will be responsible for processing payments for courses. It should integrate with payment gateways to accept various payment methods and manage payment transactions.
For writing this microservice, I would suggest using a similar RESTful API design as the other microservices. You can use the Golang "net/http" package and "gorilla/mux" package for routing and URL handling.

For payment processing, you can use a popular payment gateway such as Stripe or PayPal. These gateways provide a standardized way of handling payments and can help simplify your code.

### Content Delivery Microservice:
This microservice will be responsible for delivering course content to users. It should provide functionality to store and retrieve multimedia content such as videos, audio, and documents. It should also provide features for streaming content and handling file uploads.
For writing this microservice, I would suggest using a RESTful API design, similar to the other microservices. You can use the Golang "net/http" package and "gorilla/mux" package for routing and URL handling.

For storage, you can use a cloud-based storage service such as Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage. These services provide scalable and reliable storage for multimedia content. Alternatively, you can use a content delivery network (CDN) such as Cloudflare or Akamai to deliver content faster and improve user experience.

Overall, it's important to consider security and scalability when designing and building these microservices. You can use best practices such as input validation, authentication and authorization, and rate limiting to improve security. To improve scalability, you can use load balancing, caching, and horizontal scaling techniques such as containerization with Docker and Kubernetes.

It's also important to keep in mind that the microservices should be loosely coupled and have clear responsibilities. This can help with maintainability and make it easier to add or remove microservices in the future.

I hope this information is helpful in guiding the development of your online education platform. If you have any further questions or need additional information, please let me know!






# Project Overview
## Real-time Analytics platform
The goal of this project is to build a real-time analytics platform that collects data from various sources, processes it, and provides insights and visualizations in real-time. The platform will consist of multiple microservices, each responsible for a specific task.
