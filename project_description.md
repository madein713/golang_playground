# Project Overview
## Real-time Analytics platform
The goal of this project is to build a real-time analytics platform that collects data from various sources, processes it, and provides insights and visualizations in real-time. The platform will consist of multiple microservices, each responsible for a specific task.

## Functional Requirements
### Version 1

- The platform should be able to collect data from various sources, such as APIs, databases, and file systems.
- The platform should be able to process the collected data in real-time.
- The platform should be able to store the processed data in a database.
- The platform should be able to provide real-time insights and visualizations based on the processed data.
- The platform should provide RESTful APIs to interact with the platform.
### Version 2

- The platform should be able to handle large volumes of data in real-time.
- The platform should provide real-time alerts based on the processed data.
- The platform should be able to perform complex queries on the processed data.
- The platform should be able to automatically adjust its processing capabilities based on the incoming data volume.
- Non-Functional Requirements
- The platform should be highly available, with a minimum uptime of 99.9%.
- The platform should be scalable to handle increasing volumes of data and users.
- The platform should be secure, with proper authentication and authorization mechanisms in place.
- The platform should be easy to deploy and maintain.
## Versions
### Version 1
#### Microservices:

- Data Collector: This microservice will be responsible for collecting data from various sources and pushing it to the processing pipeline.
- Data Processor: This microservice will be responsible for processing the collected data in real-time.
- Data Storage: This microservice will be responsible for storing the processed data in a database.
- Data Visualization: This microservice will be responsible for providing real-time insights and visualizations based on the processed data.
#### APIs:

- RESTful API: This API will provide endpoints for interacting with the platform.
### Version 2
#### Microservices:

- Data Collector: This microservice will be responsible for collecting data from various sources and pushing it to the processing pipeline.
- Data Processor: This microservice will be responsible for processing the collected data in real-time.
- Data Storage: This microservice will be responsible for storing the processed data in a database.
- Data Visualization: This microservice will be responsible for providing real-time insights and visualizations based on the processed data.
- Alerting: This microservice will be responsible for providing real-time alerts based on the processed data.
- Querying: This microservice will be responsible for performing complex queries on the processed data.
- Autoscaling: This microservice will be responsible for automatically adjusting the processing capabilities based on the incoming data volume.
#### APIs:

- RESTful API: This API will provide endpoints for interacting with the platform.
## Technologies
- Go: As the main programming language for building microservices.
- Apache Kafka: As the message broker for data streaming between microservices.
- Elasticsearch: As the database for storing and querying the processed data.
- Kibana: As the visualization tool for real-time insights and visualizations.
- Prometheus: As the monitoring and alerting system for the platform.
## Conclusion
This technical task outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for building a real-time analytics platform using microservices. The project will be developed in two versions, each with specific microservices and APIs. The project will use Go as the main programming language and various other technologies, such as Apache Kafka, Elasticsearch, Kibana, and Prometheus.
